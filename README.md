# roost
An app that allows people to donate the cost of a night in a shelter

# Idea
* In it's basic form - if you see a person on the street, you can talk to them and see if they need a place to stay that night. 
* If they do, you can find a hostel or shelter near where they want to be, and donate the cost of a night's stay to that hostel, in their name. If they feel afraid and wish to remain anonymous to you, or untraceable until they get to the safety of the hostel, you can take a photo of them and in place of their name, so the hostel knows who the place is going to that night.
* If the person does not turn up by the hostel's curfew, you will have the option to either receive a credit to donate for a place at another time, or you can donate the amount directly to the hostel.

# Reason
* A lot of people feel reticent about giving money to people who are begging or appear to be homeless, as they can never be sure that it won't be spent in a way that may cause the person more harm, or put them in a more harmful position. 
* There is an awful trend targeting young people, who are the most vunerable, whereby they are forced into begging by organized crime gangs, and giving them money will open them up to more exploitation.
* This app will allow people to give a person on the street a safe place for the night, where they will be offered advice/counselling ect that could help them improve their situation.

# roost
An app that allows people to donate the cost of a night in a shelter

# Idea
* In basic form - if you see a person on the street, rather than give them money you can talk to them and see if they need a place to stay that night
* If they do, you can find a hostel or shelter near where they want to be, and donate the cost of a night's stay to that hostel, in their name. If they feel afraid and wish to remain anonymous to you, or un-traceable until they get to the safety of the hostel, you can take a photo of them in place of their name, so the hostel knows who the place is going to that night
* If the person does not turn up by the hostel's curfew, you will have the option to either donate the space to anyone else to turns up that night, receive a credit to donate a place at another time, or you can donate the amount directly to the hostel

# Reason
* A lot of people feel reticent about giving money to people who are begging or appear to be homeless, as they can never be sure that it won't be spent in a way that may cause the person more harm, or put them in a more harmful position.
* Thames Reach homeless charity cites research that 80% of money given to people on the street is then used to buy drugs or alcohol or passed on to organized crime gangs, often worsening the person's situation.
* There are street gangs targeting vulnerable young people, forcing them into begging with the profits going to organized crime. Giving them money can open them up to more exploitation.
* This app will allow people to give a person on the street a safe place for the night, where they will be offered advice/counselling/support that could help them far more than money would.

        <p>In basic form - if you see a person on the street, rather than give them money you can talk to them and see if they need a place to stay that night.</p>
        <p>If they do, you can find a hostel or shelter near where they want to be, and donate the cost of a night's stay to that hostel, in their name. If they feel afraid and wish to remain anonymous to you, or un-traceable until they get to the safety of the hostel, you can take a photo of them in place of their name, so the hostel knows who the place is going to that night.</p>
        <p>If the person does not turn up by the hostel's curfew, you will have the option to either donate the space to anyone else to turns up that night, receive a credit to donate a place at another time, or you can donate the amount directly to the hostel.</p>
